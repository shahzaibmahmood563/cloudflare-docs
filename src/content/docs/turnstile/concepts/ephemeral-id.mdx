Ephemeral IDs generate a unique short-lived ID that can link behavior to a specific client instead of an IP address without relying on setting any cookies or using similar client-side storage.

When the same visitor interacts with Turnstile widgets from different Cloudflare customers, they receive different Ephemeral IDs for each contact. In attacks where fraudsters attempt to disguise themselves using different IP addresses, Ephemeral IDs detect abuse patterns more accurately than determining whether the visitor is a human or a bot. 

Ephemeral IDs are not unique and have a lifespan of XX seconds/minutes. These IDs cannot be used to track a single visitor over multiple days as they change frequently.
